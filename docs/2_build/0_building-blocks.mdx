# Building Blocks

## DIMO Building Blocks
DIMO acts as an extensible, multi-faceted platform for secure access to vehicle and mobility data, 
empowering organizations to turn real-time vehicle signals and on-the-road events into actionable intelligence. 
Its flexible architecture supports a comprehensive data ecosystem where verifiable credentials establish authoritative truth, 
all while upholding enterprise-grade user privacy and compliance standards.

## Permissions & Consent Management
DIMO Connect offers a robust user interface seamlessly integrated with a consent management and privacy engine.
Enterprise customers and developers gain frictionless, secure pathways to request and manage data access directly from vehicle owners, 
ensuring all interactions are fully auditable and aligned with evolving global data protection and privacy regulations. 
The consent framework is purpose-built to provide both transparency and control, 
critical for organizations operating at scale in highly regulated environments.

## Signals
Real-time, granular signals from diverse and federated vehicle data sources are consistently normalized 
and persisted across highly-available, encrypted DIMO storage nodes. 
This architecture guarantees data integrity, promotes interoperability, and ensures operational reliability for mission-critical mobility applications.

## Events
Raw signal data is enhanced and contextualized into high-fidelity events by certified data providers, 
enabling enterprises to rapidly detect and respond to significant on-road occurrences. 
This event pipeline accelerates insights—such as accident detection, geofence violations, 
and service requirements—empowering organizations to build responsive, event-driven services with ease.

## Verifiable Credentials
DIMO’s credentialing infrastructure enables trusted data providers to issue tamper-evident, 
cryptographically-verifiable attestations on critical vehicle attributes and lifecycle records—including the following: 
- Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
- Odometer readings
- Vehicle health status
- Proof of location
- Proof of movement 

This approach delivers a foundational trust layer, facilitating compliance and secure data exchange across complex automotive and mobility ecosystems.
