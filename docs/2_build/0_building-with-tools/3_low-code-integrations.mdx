# Low Code Integrations

## Get started using drag-and-drop interfaces
Knowing the in's and out's of how the API and SDK works is great, but when you are short on resources or time, building and maintaining a fullstack application may feel draining.
DIMO offers developers and non-developers an easy way to build data integration through working with the leading low code platforms in the industry.

## How It Works

	</Step>
	<Step title="Setup Your First Workflow">
		Setting up your first workflow on the platform of your choice. 
		To start, simply set up trigger(s) and add action(s).
		Triggers are conditionals (systematically-triggered, time-triggered, event-triggered, or even manually triggered) where the workflow will automatically start. 
		Actions are where the workflow executes something. DIMO is supported on both triggers & actions.
