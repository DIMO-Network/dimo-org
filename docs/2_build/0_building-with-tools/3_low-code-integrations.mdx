# Low Code Integrations

## Get started using drag-and-drop interfaces
Knowing the in's and out's of how the API and SDK works is great, but when you are short on resources or time, building and maintaining a fullstack application may feel draining.
DIMO offers developers and non-developers an easy way to build data integration through working with the leading low code platforms in the industry.
