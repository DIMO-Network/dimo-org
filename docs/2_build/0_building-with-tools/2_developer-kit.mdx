# Developer Kit

## Using Client & Server SDKs Together
[DIMO Developer Kit (DDK)](https://replit.com/t/dimo/repls/DIMO-Developer-Kit/view#README.md) is a boilerplate code that the DIMO Team has provided to quickly get you started. It integrates
both the [DIMO Connect Client SDK](/docs/build/building-with-tools/client-sdk-dimo-connect) and the [Server SDK](/docs/build/building-with-tools/server-sdk) in Typescript.
Deploying an app literally takes you less than **60 seconds**.

  <Step title="Remix the App">
		Powered by Replit, you can either [remix the app on Replit](https://replit.com/t/dimo/repls/DIMO-Developer-Kit/view#README.md) as shown here or [fork the GitHub repository](https://github.com/DIMO-Network/dimo-developer-kit) directly.

          text: "The code of the boilerplate, it is also open-sourced and hosted on GitHub."
        }
      ]}
    />
	</Step>

  <Step title="Update Secrets on the App">
		You will need to update the secrets required on the Developer Kit boilerplate. 
		You can find these keys in the [Developer Console](https://console.dimo.org):
		- Client ID: `DIMO_CLIENT_ID` & `VITE_DIMO_CLIENT_ID`
		- Redirect URI: `DIMO_REDIRECT_URI` & `VITE_DIMO_REDIRECT_URI`
		- API Key: `DIMO_API_KEY`
	</Step>
	<Step title="Preview & Deploy">
		Once secrets are updated, simply restart your app and you're ready to deploy your first DIMO app.
	</Step>
