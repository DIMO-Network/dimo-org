# Create Your Account

<h4>Get registered as a DIMO developer</h4>

The DIMO Developer Console is a self-service portal that assists with developers
in getting their Developer License, configuring API Keys, viewing information of
shared vehicles, and purchasing API credits. You can also track your credit
usage directly within the DIMO Developer Console as well.

To get started, head to <span className="special-links"> console.dimo.org</span>
and sign up for an account using either your email address, or via one of the
available social login links. If you've already registered for an account with
DIMO mobile, you can log in to the DIMO Developer Console with the same email
address here.
