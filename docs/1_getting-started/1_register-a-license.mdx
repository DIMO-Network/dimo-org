# Register a Developer License

#### Register your DIMO Developer License

Before accessing the DIMO APIs, you will need to obtain and configure a
Developer License. 

:::info Developer Notes

Developer Licenses are FREE, and the name that you give your license is
public and unique amongst the DIMO Network.

:::


#### How It Works

	<Stepper>
		<Step title="Login">
			Login to your DIMO Account via the [Console](https://console.dimo.org).
		</Step>
		<Step title="Create Your License" image="/img/Register-license.png"> 
			Once you're logged into your DIMO Account, simply give your license a name and hit
			`Create`.  
		</Step>
		<Step title="Configure Your License">
			1. Generate at least a set of `API Key` and make sure you copy the secret and save it somewhere safe.
			:::info API Key Best Practices
				Save and store your keys in a secure vault, as DIMO will only display this key once during generation
				and will not store your API secrets. We highly recommend that you rotate your API Keys on a
				regular basis for enhanced security.
			:::

			2. Configure at least one `Redirect URI`, this is used for both authentication and for redirecting 
			users back to your application when you're building a client-side flow with DIMO. 

			:::info Redirect URI Best Practices
			A Redirect URI should be a valid domain (ideally some domain you own) and must include `http://` or `https://`.
			You're also welcome to use `localhost` while you're in the build phase.
			:::

		</Step>
		<Step title="Sharing Your License">
		<!-- TODO: DVR-710 -->
			Locate the `Token ID`, `Client ID`, and `Redirect URI` from your Developer License. 
			Share these with anyone that's working with you on your app.
			For `API Keys`, please follow our best practices and share using a secured vault.
		</Step>
		<Step title="Using Your License">
			You will need a Developer JWT in order to start interacting with most APIs, go to the next section to learn more about authentication.
		</Step>
