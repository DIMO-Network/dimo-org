# Developer Types

The DIMO Network enables vehicles to be part of a protocol where users have
digital ownership over their vehicle data (as an asset) and have the ability to
earn rewards when sharing that data with a service provider. As a developer with
great ideas, you can come in as one or more of the following roles:

- **Data Providers**
  - Build hardware similar to the R1 LTE
  - Integrate with OEM platforms and provide vehicle data to the DIMO Network
- **Data Consumers**
  - Build a mobile or web application that customized the full DIMO experience
    with vehicle permission sharing, similar to the DIMO Mobile App.
  - Build a mobile or web app that utilizes the DIMO Connect component to get
    users sharing their vehicle permissions and subscribing to your service.
- **Data Storage Providers**
  - Run a DIMO Storage Node on-premise to store vehicle data
- **Data Validators** (Coming Soon)
  - Run an attestation service to validate data

## Developers Are Data Providers & Consumers

Building on DIMO offers several paths, simplified here into two main routes:
Data Providers and Data Consumers. Within the two respective routes, you can
choose to be any of the following: hardware manufacturer, integrated data
provider, web app builder, and mobile app builder. Each route provides a unique
entry point to the DIMO ecosystem, connecting you to our network of consumers
and vehicles.

### Data Providers

Being an integrated data provider means you are providing data to the DIMO
protocol. This can be done either by manufacturing a device similar to the R1
LTE or by connecting to a vehicle data source. Data providers plug in to the
DIMO Network and provide data via an Oracle.

### Data Consumer

Being a data consumer can mean many things: you might be building a web or mobile application that provides some service to DIMO users, or maybe you're collecting data to train LLMs based on realtime vehicle data.
