## Technical Comparison

### API Design

**DIMO:**
```javascript
// Consistent, normalized data across all OEMs
const vehicles = await dimo.vehicles.list();
const telemetry = await dimo.telemetry.latest(vehicleId);
// Same structure for Tesla, Ford, BMW, etc.
```

**SmartCar:**
```javascript
// Similar approach, fewer OEMs
const vehicles = await smartcar.getVehicles(accessToken);
const location = await vehicle.location();
```

**Direct OEM APIs:**
```javascript
// Different for each OEM
const teslaData = await teslaAPI.getVehicleData(teslaId);
const fordData = await fordAPI.getVehicleStatus(fordVIN);
const bmwData = await bmwAPI.vehicles(bmwId).status();
// Must normalize yourself!
```

### Data Latency
