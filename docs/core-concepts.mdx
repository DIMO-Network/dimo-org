# Core Concepts

This guide will dive deeper into the core concepts of DIMO, which will help
developers better understand the entire DIMO tech stack, such as permissions management
flows, getting telemetry data, and building stateful AI agents for your business.

## Developer Console

The DIMO Developer Console is your main entrypoint into the DIMO Developer
ecosystem. This is where developers can manage their API keys, DIMO connect
configurations, AI agents, webhooks, and more. To get started, just [create an
account](https://console.dimo.org/sign-in) and create a Developer License.

## Developer License

A DIMO Developer License is what enables developers to build on and integrate
with the platform. Each license has a unique name on the DIMO network, and more
importantly, a unique `clientId` that starts with `0x`. The details of your
license are publicly viewable to anyone on the DIMO network, aside from private
information like your email address or API keys.

## Permissions Contract: SACD

On DIMO, the Service Access Contract Definition (SACD) is the novel permissions contract that enables users to publicly
declare which data they elect to share with a given developers. In the same way,
it is how developers _request_ data from a user. This is one of the main
features of DIMO that sets it apart from all other vehicle telemetry or agentic
platforms – there's a robust privacy layer built-in, and **SACD is that privacy
layer.**
Most simply, SACD enables this:

- Developer asks: _"Can I have your vehicles current location, past location,
  and all of its telemetry data?"_

- User responds: _"Yes, you can have all of that data."_

If a user elects to not share their vehicle data with a developer, then that
developer cannot access their data. Here, DIMO enables developers to create
compelling applications and vehicular agents that users will want to share their
data with.


## DIMO Connect

Also known as: Login with DIMO (LIWD)

Available as both an open source Client SDK, or as a simple redirect URL, DIMO
Connect is the frontend component that enables developers to implement the SACD
permissions contract for requesting user data. Your users sign in with an email
address and a passkey or one-time-passcode, and grant you permissions to their
data.

Now that you understand some of the core concepts on DIMO, you can start
learning more about what types of applicatons or intelligent agents you can build.
