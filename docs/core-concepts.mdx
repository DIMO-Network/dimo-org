# Key Concepts

This guide will dive deeper into the core concepts of DIMO, which will help
developers better understand the entire DIMO tech stack, such as the permissions management
flows, getting telemetry data, and building stateful AI agents.

DIMO acts as an extensible, multi-faceted platform for secure access to vehicle and mobility data,
empowering organizations to turn real-time vehicle signals and on-the-road events into actionable intelligence.
Its flexible architecture supports a comprehensive data ecosystem where verifiable credentials establish authoritative truth,
all while upholding enterprise-grade user privacy and compliance standards.

## Developer Ecosystem

### Developer Console

The DIMO Developer Console is your main entrypoint into the DIMO Developer
ecosystem. This is where developers can manage their API keys, DIMO connect
configurations, AI agents, webhooks, and more. To get started, just [create an
account](https://console.dimo.org/sign-in) and create a Developer License.

### Developer License

A DIMO Developer License is what enables developers to build on and integrate
with the platform. Each license has a unique name on the DIMO network, and more
importantly, a unique `clientId` that starts with `0x`. The details of your
license are publicly viewable to anyone on the DIMO network, aside from private
information like your email address or API keys.

## Identity & Permissions

### Permissions & Consent Management

DIMO Connect offers a robust user interface seamlessly integrated with a consent management and privacy engine.
Enterprise customers and developers gain frictionless, secure pathways to request and manage data access directly from vehicle owners,
ensuring all interactions are fully auditable and aligned with evolving global data protection and privacy regulations.
The consent framework is purpose-built to provide both transparency and control,
critical for organizations operating at scale in highly regulated environments.

### Permissions Contract: SACD

On DIMO, the Service Access Contract Definition (SACD) is the novel permissions contract that enables users to publicly
declare which data they elect to share with a given developers. In the same way,
it is how developers _request_ data from a user. This is one of the main
features of DIMO that sets it apart from all other vehicle telemetry or agentic
platforms – there's a robust privacy layer built-in, and **SACD is that privacy
layer.**
Most simply, SACD enables this:

- Developer asks: _"Can I have your vehicles current location, past location,
  and all of its telemetry data?"_

- User responds: _"Yes, you can have all of that data."_

If a user elects to not share their vehicle data with a developer, then that
developer cannot access their data. Here, DIMO enables developers to create
compelling applications and vehicular agents that users will want to share their
data with.

### DIMO Connect

Also known as: Login with DIMO (LIWD)

Available as both an open source Client SDK, or as a simple redirect URL, DIMO
Connect is the frontend component that enables developers to implement the SACD
permissions contract for requesting user data. Your users sign in with an email
address and a passkey or one-time-passcode, and grant you permissions to their
data.

## Vehicle Data

### Signals

Real-time, granular signals from diverse and federated vehicle data sources are consistently normalized
and persisted across highly-available, encrypted DIMO storage nodes.
This architecture guarantees data integrity, promotes interoperability, and ensures operational reliability for mission-critical mobility applications.

Learn more about getting vehicle signals using [Telemetry API](/docs/api-references/telemetry-api/signals).

### Events

Raw signal data is enhanced and contextualized into high-fidelity events by certified data providers,
enabling enterprises to rapidly detect and respond to significant on-road occurrences.
This event pipeline accelerates insights—such as accident detection, geofence violations,
and service requirements—empowering organizations to build responsive, event-driven services with ease.

### Attestations

DIMO’s credentialing infrastructure enables trusted data providers to issue tamper-evident,
cryptographically-verifiable attestations on critical vehicle attributes and lifecycle records—including the following:
- Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
- Odometer readings
- Vehicle health status
- Proof of position

This approach delivers a foundational trust layer, facilitating compliance and secure data exchange across complex automotive and mobility ecosystems.

API](/docs/api-references/attestation-api).
