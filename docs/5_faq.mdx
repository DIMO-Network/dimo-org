## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Is DIMO compliant with data regulations?

**Yes!** DIMO is fully compliant:

✅ **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**
- User right to access, deletion, and portability
- Data processing transparency
- Consent management built-in

✅ **EU Data Act**
- User ownership of vehicle data
- Freedom to share data with third parties
- No vendor lock-in

✅ **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)**
- Resident privacy rights
- Data disclosure requirements
- Opt-out mechanisms

**Privacy architecture:**
- 🔐 End-to-end encryption
- 👤 User-owned data (not DIMO-owned)
- 🎛️ Granular permission controls
- ⛓️ Blockchain-backed audit trail
- 🚫 No data selling - ever

### Who owns the vehicle data?

**The vehicle owner owns their data** - not DIMO, not your application.

**How it works:**
1. Vehicle owner grants permissions to a 3rd party app
2. The app can access data while permission is active
3. Owner can revoke access at any time, works just like your Google account
4. DIMO acts as secure intermediary, not data owner

**Benefits for developers and OEMs:**
- ✅ Clear data ownership model
- ✅ Regulatory compliance by default
- ✅ User trust and transparency
- ✅ No liability for data storage
