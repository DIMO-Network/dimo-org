# DIMO Developer License
<h4>Create your DIMO Developer License</h4>

Before accessing the DIMO APIs, you will need to obtain and configure a Developer License. You can 
easily obtain a Developer License directly via the console. Once you're logged in, simply give your 
license a name and hit "Create". 

:::info Developer Notes

Creating a Developer License is FREE, and the name that you give your license is public to all other developers. 
Your Developer License name is like a username - it must be unique amongst all the existing licenses on the DIMO Network.

Once your license is created, you will be redirected to your license detail page. This includes your license credentials 
and will be where you can configure additional settings. You should take note of the following:

`Client ID` – The public key for your DIMO Developer License, located underneath your license name. Can be used to retrieve public information about your license, as well as for with authentication purposes.


`Token ID` – The unique number associated with your license, which is located to the left of your license name. Can be used to retrieve public information about your license.

<h4>Manage Your License</h4>

<h5>API Keys</h5>
In your license details, you will need to generate an API Key (also known as private keys) to use for authentication. When generating a new API
Key, it's important that you save and store your keys in a secure vault, as DIMO will only display this key once and does not store your API keys.
Your API Key will only be displayed once, and we also recommend that you rotate your API Keys on a regular basis for enhanced security.

<h5>Redirect URIs</h5>
You should also configure at least one `Redirect URI` as you're getting started. Redirect URIs are used for both authentication and for redirecting 
users back to your application when you're using the Login with DIMO component. A Redirect URI should be a valid domain that you own and must include `http://` 
or `https://`. You're also welcome to use `localhost` while you're in the build phase.

<h4>Using Your License</h4>

With a valid combination of the three parameters (Client ID, API key, and Redirect URI), you have now everything you need to access DIMO APIs. 
For more information, check out how to use these details with the Data SDK or the Login Component SDK.  

<h5>Vehicles Table</h5>

You can easily see the the vehicles that have provided privileged access with your developer license via the Vehicles Table at the bottom 
of your License Details Page. In the table you'll be able to see each vehicle's `Token ID`, `Token DID`, and the Make, Model, and Year.

If there are no vehicles shared with your license yet, check out how to get started with Login with DIMO.
