      <h2>Introduction</h2>

    The Identity API serves as an open registry for vehicles and developers on the DIMO Network. All data in the Identity API is public, can be read by anyone, and does not require any authentication. The DIMO Identity API is written in graphQL, and there is only a single endpoint, <code>/query</code>, which is used for executing queries.

      <h3> Schema and Types</h3>
      The basic unit of components of a GraphQL schema are object types - it represents an object you can fetch for and the definitions of what fields will be included in the response. A representation of GraphQL schema language may look like this in Identity API:

     <ParametersBlock
      title=""
      parameters={[
        {
          name: "SyntheticDevice",
          description: "SyntheticDevice is a GraphQL Object Type, meaning it's a type with some fields. Most of the types in your schema will be object types."
        },
        {
          name: "tokenId, integrationId, address, and mintedAt",
          description: "Fields on the SyntheticDevice type. That means these 4 fields can appear in any part of a GraphQL query that operates on the SyntheticDevice type."
        },
        {
          name: "Int",
          description: "One of the built-in scalar types - these are types that resolve to a single scalar object, and can't have sub-selections in the query."
        },
        {
          name: "Int!",
          description: "Means that the field is non-nullable, meaning that the DIMO GraphQL service promises to always return a value when queried."
        },
      ]}
    />
    </div>
  }
  rightColumn={
          <pre><code className="language-graphql">{`type SyntheticDevice {
    tokenId: Int!
    integrationId: Int!
    address: Address!
    mintedAt: Time!
}`}</code></pre>
  }
/>

      <h3> Scalars</h3>
      Scalars are the value types that every field in a GraphQL document eventually resolves to. It can be viewed as the primitive data type that stores a single value. There are 5 built-in scalars: int, float, string, Boolean, and id - we have also defined custom scalars to help define the data we return.

     <ParametersBlock
      title=""
      parameters={[
        {
          name: "Address",
          description: "A 20-byte Ethereum address, encoded as a checksummed hex string with 0x prefix."
        },
        {
          name: "BigDecimal",
          description: "An arbitrary-precision decimal data type, per the General Decimal Arithmetic specification."
        },
        {
          name: "BigInt",
          description: "An integer of arbitrary precision, decimal-encoded. Typically a uint256."
        },
        {
          name: "Boolean",
          description: "Represents a boolean value that can be either true or false."
        },
        {
          name: "Bytes",
          description: "An array of byte, encoded as a lowercase hex string with 0x prefix."
        },
        {
          name: "Float",
          description: "A signed double-precision floating-point value."
        },
        {
          name: "ID",
          description: "A unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as a key for caching."
        },
        {
          name: "Int",
          description: "A signed 32-bit integer."
        },
        {
          name: "String",
          description: "A UTF-8 character sequence."
        },
        {
          name: "Time",
          description: "A point in time, encoded per RFC-3999. This is in second precision and in UTC, an example would be 2023-12-04T18:32:12Z."
        },
