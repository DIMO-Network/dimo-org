# Agents API <Badge variant="pre-alpha">⚠️ Alpha Software</Badge>

:::danger IMPORTANT
Be aware, the Agents API is in active development and **is highly subject to change**. We recommend developers use this page as a general
guide to understanding the overarching concepts of the API, which will be publicly
available in beta soon.

**Please build at your own risk.**
:::

Create, chat with, and stream messages from intelligent vehicle agents.

## Overview

<TwoColumnLayout
  leftColumn={
    <div>
      The DIMO Agents API enables developers to create intelligent AI agents that can interact with vehicle data through natural language. These agents can query vehicle information, real-time telemetry, perform web searches to answer questions about vehicles and nearby services, and more.

      <h3>Key Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Create AI agents with vehicle-specific access</li>
        <li>Query vehicle identity data (make, model, year, owner)</li>
        <li>Access real-time telemetry data (speed, fuel, location, battery)</li>
        <li>Perform location-based web searches ("Find replacement parts near me")</li>
        <li>Stream responses in real-time using Server-Sent Events</li>
        <li>Maintain conversation history and context</li>
      </ul>

    </div>
  }
  rightColumn={
    <div>
      <BaseUrlBlock url="https://agents.dimo.zone"/>

## Personalities

The Agents API comes pre-defined personalities that can be used when creating
your agents. These personalities come packaged with a pre-defined prompt, along
with a typical starter message.

### `uncle_mechanic`
**Prompt**:
> You are a warm, experienced automotive advisor who treats users like family.

{/* ## Use Cases

### Customer Support Chatbots
Create intelligent chatbots that can answer customer questions about their vehicles, including identity information, current status, and nearby services.

### Fleet Management Dashboards
Build admin agents with unrestricted access to monitor and query multiple vehicles in a fleet simultaneously.

### Mobile Apps
Integrate streaming responses into mobile applications for real-time conversational experiences with vehicle data.

### Voice Assistants
Use the Conversations API as a backend for voice-enabled vehicle assistants that can understand natural language queries.

### Location-Based Services
Enable agents to find nearby mechanics, tire shops, charging stations, and other services relevant to the vehicle's current location. */}

{/* ## Best Practices

### Authentication
Always include your developer JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for all API requests. Keep your JWT secure and never expose it in client-side code.

### Vehicle Access Control
- Use explicit `vehicleIds` arrays for production applications to maintain clear access boundaries
- Use `vehicleIds: null` for development when you want automatic ownership validation
- Use admin mode sparingly and only for internal tools

### Streaming vs Synchronous
- Use streaming endpoints for user-facing interfaces to provide immediate feedback
- Use synchronous endpoints for backend integrations or when you need the complete response at once

### Error Handling
Handle common error cases:
- **403 Forbidden**: Missing or invalid developer JWT
- **404 Not Found**: Agent doesn't exist
- **409 Conflict**: Trying to create an agent with conflicting configuration
- **422 Unprocessable Entity**: Invalid request parameters

### Rate Limiting
Be mindful of API rate limits and implement appropriate backoff strategies for high-volume applications. */}
