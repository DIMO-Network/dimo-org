# Telemetry Playground

Build and execute custom telemetry queries using the interactive query builder below. Select signals, configure aggregations, and run queries directly against the DIMO Telemetry API.

:::info Authentication Required
The Telemetry API requires authentication with a Vehicle JWT token. You'll need:
- A Developer License (get one at the [Developer Console](https://console.dimo.org))
- Vehicle permissions granted to your license
- Your Client ID, Redirect URI, and API Key

Learn more about authentication in our [Authentication Guide](/docs/getting-started/authentication).

## Interactive Query Builder

Use the builder below to compose and execute telemetry queries. The builder supports both current values (`signalsLatest`) and historical time series data (`signals`) with customizable aggregations.

<TelemetryQueryBuilder />

## Query Types

### signalsLatest
Returns the most recent value for each selected signal. Perfect for dashboards and real-time monitoring.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Current vehicle speed and location
- Latest battery charge level
- Current ignition status

### signals
Returns time series data with configurable aggregation over a date range. Ideal for analytics and historical analysis.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Average speed over the past week
- Maximum battery charge during a road trip
- Fuel consumption trends over time

## Signal Categories

The Telemetry API provides signals across 8 categories:

- **Location**: GPS coordinates, altitude
- **Vehicle Status**: Speed, ignition status, odometer
- **Battery & Fuel**: Charge levels, fuel levels, range
- **Engine**: RPM, temperature, oil level, throttle
- **Tire Pressure**: All four wheel pressures
- **Environment**: Temperature, barometric pressure
- **Device/Network**: WiFi status and connectivity
- **Diagnostics**: Error codes, runtime

## Aggregation Types

When querying historical data (`signals`), you can choose different aggregation methods:

**For Numeric Signals:**
- **AVG**: Average value over the interval
- **MAX**: Maximum value
- **MIN**: Minimum value
- **MED**: Median value
- **FIRST**: First recorded value
- **LAST**: Last recorded value
- **RAND**: Random sample

**For String Signals:**
- **RAND**: Random sample
- **TOP**: Most frequently occurring value
- **UNIQUE**: List of unique values

## Tips

ðŸ’¡ **JWT Expiration**: Vehicle JWTs expire after 10 minutes. You'll need to generate a new one if it expires.

ðŸ’¡ **Date Ranges**: For historical queries, keep date ranges reasonable (days to weeks) to ensure fast response times.

ðŸ’¡ **Multiple Signals**: You can select as many signals as needed - they'll all be included in a single query.

ðŸ’¡ **Copy Queries**: Use the copy button to save queries for use in your own applications.
