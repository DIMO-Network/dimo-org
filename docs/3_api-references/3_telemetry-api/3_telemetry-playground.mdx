# Telemetry Playground

Build custom telemetry queries using the interactive query builder below. Select signals, configure aggregations, and generate GraphQL queries to use with the DIMO Telemetry API.

:::info Authentication Required
The Telemetry API requires authentication with a Vehicle JWT token. You'll need:
- A Developer License (get one at the [Developer Console](https://console.dimo.org))
- Vehicle permissions granted to your license

Learn more about authentication in our [Authentication Guide](/docs/getting-started/authentication).

## Interactive Query Builder

Use the builder below to compose telemetry queries. The builder supports both current values (`signalsLatest`) and historical time series data (`signals`) with customizable aggregations. Copy the generated query and paste it into the playground below to execute it.

<TelemetryQueryBuilder />

## Query Types

### signalsLatest
Returns the most recent value for each selected signal. Perfect for dashboards and real-time monitoring.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Current vehicle speed and location
- Latest battery charge level
- Current ignition status

### signals
Returns time series data with configurable aggregation over a date range. Ideal for analytics and historical analysis.

**Example Use Cases:**
- Average speed over the past week
- Maximum battery charge during a road trip
- Fuel consumption trends over time

## Signal Categories

The Telemetry API provides signals across 11 categories:

- **Location**: GPS coordinates, altitude (precise and approximate)
- **Vehicle Status**: Speed, ignition, odometer, VIN, powertrain type, range
- **Battery & EV**: State of charge, charging status, power flow, capacity, session energy
- **Fuel**: Fuel level (percentage and liters), supported fuel types
- **Engine**: RPM, coolant temperature, oil level, throttle position, air intake, load
- **Tire Pressure**: All four wheel pressures (front left/right, rear left/right)
- **Environment**: Outside temperature, barometric pressure
- **Doors**: Status of all four doors (front/rear driver/passenger)
- **Windows**: Status of all four windows (front/rear driver/passenger)
- **Device/Network**: WiFi status, GPS satellite count and precision
- **Diagnostics**: Diagnostic trouble codes, runtime, intake temperature

## Aggregation Types

When querying historical data (`signals`), you can choose different aggregation methods:

**For Numeric Signals:**
- **AVG**: Average value over the interval
- **MAX**: Maximum value
- **MIN**: Minimum value
- **MED**: Median value
- **FIRST**: First recorded value
- **LAST**: Last recorded value
- **RAND**: Random sample

**For String Signals:**
- **RAND**: Random sample
- **TOP**: Most frequently occurring value
- **UNIQUE**: List of unique values

## GraphQL Playground

Use the GraphQL playground below to execute queries against the live Telemetry API. You can paste queries generated from the builder above, or write your own custom queries. You'll need a valid Vehicle JWT token to authenticate your requests.

<GraphQLPlayground
  title="DIMO Telemetry API Playground"
  endpoint="https://telemetry-api.dimo.zone/"
  query={`query {
  signalsLatest(tokenId: <vehicle_token_id>) {
    lastSeen
    speed {
      timestamp
      value
    }
    latitude {
      timestamp
      value
    }
    longitude {
      timestamp
      value
    }
  }
}`}
  variables={{}}
  height="700px"
/>

## Tips

💡 **JWT Authentication**: Vehicle JWTs expire after 10 minutes. You'll need to generate a new one if it expires. Add your JWT token in the HTTP Headers section of the playground as: `{"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"}`

💡 **Date Ranges**: For historical queries, keep date ranges reasonable (days to weeks) to ensure fast response times.

💡 **Multiple Signals**: You can select as many signals as needed - they'll all be included in a single query.

💡 **Copy Queries**: Use the copy button in the query builder to easily transfer queries to the playground below.
