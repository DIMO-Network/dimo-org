# Fetch API Playground

Run GraphQL queries against the Fetch API using the playground below.

:::info Authentication Required
The Fetch API requires a Vehicle JWT with **raw data** permission. You need:
- A [Developer License](https://console.dimo.org)
- The vehicle shared with your app with raw data permission

See the [Authentication Guide](/docs/getting-started/authentication) and [Token Exchange API](/docs/api-references/token-exchange-api) for how to request a token with the correct privileges.
:::

## GraphQL Playground

Use the playground to try the four root queries: <code>latestIndex</code>, <code>indexes</code>, <code>latestCloudEvent</code>, and <code>cloudEvents</code>. Replace the <code>did</code> placeholder with a valid ERC721 DID for a vehicle you have access to.

<GraphQLPlayground
  title="DIMO Fetch API Playground"
  endpoint="https://fetch-api.dimo.zone/"
  query={`query {
  latestCloudEvent(
    did: "did:eth:1:0x...:YOUR_TOKEN_ID",
    filter: { type: "dimo.status" }
  ) {
    header {
      id
      type
      time
      source
      producer
    }
    data
  }
}`}
  variables={{}}
  height="700px"
/>

## Tips

**JWT in headers**: Add your Vehicle JWT in the HTTP Headers section of the playground as: `{"Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"}`

**Vehicle DID**: The <code>did</code> argument is the ERC721 DID (e.g. <code>did:eth:1:0xContractAddress:tokenId</code>). You can resolve it from the Identity API or your token exchange flow.

**Select fields**: Request only the fields you need (e.g. `header` with subfields like `id`, `type`, `time`, and `data`) to keep responses small.
