# DIMO Connect

<h4>Expedite your build using DIMO Connect</h4>

DIMO Connect is a **robust privacy engine** that allows app developers to
specify and request data from vehicle owners. Developers can get started using
either the React Component SDK or by simply creating a DIMO Connect URL.

### How It Works

<Stepper>
  <Step title="User Authentication">
    Users connect their DIMO account and authenticate through our secure OAuth flow. This ensures that only authorized users can share their vehicle data with your application.
  </Step>

<Step title="Vehicle Selection">
  Once authenticated, users can select which of their connected vehicles they
  want to share data from. DIMO supports a wide range of vehicle makes and
  models.
</Step>

<Step title="Data Permission">
  Users review and approve the specific data types your application is
  requesting. This gives users full control over what information they share.
</Step>

  <Step title="Data Access">
    Your application receives secure access to the approved vehicle data through our APIs. You can now build amazing experiences with real-time and historical vehicle data.
  </Step>
</Stepper>

### Try It Yourself

<Stepper>
  <Step title="Install the SDK" image="/img/DeveloperConsole.png">
    Install the DIMO Connect React SDK in your project:

    ```bash
    npm install @dimo-network/connect-react
    ```

    Or use the simple URL approach if you prefer a lightweight integration.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your App">
    Set up your DIMO Connect configuration with your client credentials:

    ```javascript
    import { DimoConnect } from '@dimo-network/connect-react';

    const config = {
      clientId: 'your-client-id',
      redirectUri: 'https://yourapp.com/callback'
    };
    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch the Flow">
    Trigger the DIMO Connect flow when users want to connect their vehicle:

    ```javascript
    <DimoConnect
      config={config}
      onSuccess={(data) => console.log('Vehicle connected!', data)}
      onError={(error) => console.error('Connection failed:', error)}
    />
    ```

  </Step>
</Stepper>
